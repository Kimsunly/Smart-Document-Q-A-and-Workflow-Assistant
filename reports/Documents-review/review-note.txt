=====================
🛠 How to Read and Extract Ideas from These Recent Works:

    1. Start with Abstract + Introduction + Contributions
        _ Write down: What is the new idea or improvement?
        _ What problem does it address that earlier systems didn’t?
    2. Look for Architecture Diagrams
        _ They often show modules like “Retriever”, “Generator / Reader”, “Verification / Explainability”, “Fusion / Aggregation.”
        _ Compare their architecture modules with yours — note extra modules they add, or simplify.
    3.Read Method / Model Sections Closely
        _ Focus particularly on retrieval techniques, reasoning / multi-hop modules, fusion of context, visual / layout modeling, explainability.
        _ Mark parts you don’t fully understand yet; sometimes you can skip deep math but understand the mechanism in words.
    4. Evaluation / Experiments
        _ See which datasets they use (e.g. DocHop-QA).
        _ What metrics do they report? (Accuracy, F1, latency, interpretability)
        _ Compare  performance of baseline vs their method, especially in “hard” cases (multi-hop, ambiguous queries).
    5. Ablation Studies and Error Analysis
        _ See which components contribute the most.
        _ See failure cases: what do they struggle with?
        _ That gives you ideas for what your system might struggle with and what to plan for in future.
    6.Limitations / Future Work
        _ Authors often admit what they couldn’t solve — use those as “inspiration” or “caution” for planning your project.
        _ Mark which of their future work align with your Phase 2 ideas.
    7. Take Notes & Compare
        + For each paper, write:
        – Novel idea / contribution
        – What they do better than older systems
        – What they leave as challenge / future
        – Which parts you can adopt in your project now / later
+ What the system is, why they built it, and what it achieved.
+ “What problem do they solve? How?”
