# Day 1 – Environment Setup

## Goal

Set up the development environment and project structure to start coding.

## What I Did

- Installed Python 3.10+
- Installed VS Code and set up Python extensions
- Installed GitHub Desktop and initialized Git in VS Code
- Created project folder structure:
    smart-doc-assistant/
    ├── data/
    ├── notebooks/
    ├── src/
    ├── report/
    └── README.md
- Initialized GitHub repository and committed empty folders + README

## Results

Python and VS Code are ready for development
Project folder structure is organized and ready for files
GitHub repository is set up for version control

## Next Steps

- Install core libraries (pypdf, scikit-learn, streamlit) and create requirements.txt (Day 2 plan)
