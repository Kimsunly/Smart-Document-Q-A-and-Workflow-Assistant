# Day 2 â€“ Library Installation

## Goal

Install core libraries and verify environment.

## What I Did

- Installed `pypdf`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`
- Tested imports in Python
- Created and pushed `requirements.txt` to GitHub

## Results

- All libraries imported successfully
- requirements.txt added at project root

## Next Steps
